# Music Player App

A requirement from WebArt Technologies

## Getting Started

This app is an simple music playing application built on flutter.

The Ui and other resources are taken from this link 
https://wrappedinmusic.com/song-list (mentioned in the mail)   

# Features
    1. Play/Pause music.
    2. Volume control.
    3. Background playing with ongoing notification 
       (music will still remain playing even the app has been killed). 
    4. Previous/Next button for changing audio position.
    5. Start/End button for changing the current music.
    6. Audio Progress Bar Control.
    7. Filter musics based category or sub-category.


# I Have Used 
    GetX state management system for managing the UI state. 
    Dio retrofit for api calling.
    Just Audio for audio related features.
